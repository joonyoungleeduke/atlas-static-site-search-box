## Example

* You will need to configure **APP_ID** in constants.ts and your Realm App will need to comply with the specifications in the top-level `README.md`
* This example is either up to date with or an older version of [Atlas Static Site Search](https://github.com/mongodben/atlas-static-site-search).

## Running

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is linked to the atlas-static-site-search-box package in the parent directory for development purposes.

You can run `yarn install` and then `yarn start` to test your package.
